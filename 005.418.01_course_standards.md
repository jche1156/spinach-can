# Web Development Initiation

As students attaining a CS degree, many of our pupils express an interest in building applicable work experience. Yet, a lot of systemic issues prevent them from accessing such opportunities. Living in San Francisco, we can do a lot better than that, and this course is meant to serve as a bridge that takes someone from a beginner to an intermediate user of the technology we use most often.

# Alignment / Background

This idea came about as a result of a chance interaction with a few pupils during my time tutoring at CCSF. "I don't feel ready" and "I need experience to get a job", as well as similar lines of thinking really held students back. Looking at the curriculum implemented there, I get the sense that the students are actually referring to a mismatch between what they see employers asking for, and what they seem to be creating in class.

# Problem

There are a few misconceptions I want to fend off during this course:
- "Out of Time/Desperation"
    - Grant better perspective on how time spent works
    - Provide ample support along the way
        - Measure improvements? Be more mindful about how we depict progress

- "Low Performer/Not Confident/I Don't Know How/I am not qualitified"
    - Due to a chronic lack of support in the public education system a lot of our students show up totally unaccustomed to how things get done during the matter of working as a developer
    - This "development loop" is actually fairly straightforward to learn, but crucial to work into regular practice.
    - We get huge gains in confidence by equipping our students with better tools and realistic procedures
    - They need to be given adequate leeway to fail, and also learn that failure is a science they can cultivate
