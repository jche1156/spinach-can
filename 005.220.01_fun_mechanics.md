I want to use common game mechanics to create fun situations that call for things that seem boring or unrelated

For example, to create a reward for building an echo server, I could offer the player a companion which copies and duals their spells.

As an added bonus, many of these mechanics are often quite straightforward to implement in terms of logic, so we'd be going along with the flow in terms of choosing lessons and rewards.
